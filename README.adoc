*C-ITS Credential Management System* by *IP Telecom* in *Portugal*.

(this is work in progress...)


## Introduction

The European Commission (EC) runs a C-ITS Point of Contact (CPOC). It provides a Trust List Manager (TLM) and a European Certificate Trust Lists (ECTL). Further details are here https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ +

Current EC CPOC artifacts can be found at:

* TLM:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/gettlmcertificate
* LINK:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/gettlmlinkcertificate
* ECTL:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/getectl/1D261F9E338ECB5B

We run a PKI provider base on the current C-ITS security standards: +

At the moment the our PKI services are based on a Root Certification Authority (RCA) registered at the EC's https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECTL.html[ECTL Level 0] trust domain, intended mainly for testing and pilot use cases. +


## Access

The main base URL for our current PKI services is: *https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/*

For reference, and manual or scripted access, current artifacts published by our PKI are publicly accessible in native binary OER encoding at:

* Root CA registered at the ECTL Level 0
** RCA:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/85987527EE188A49
** RCA-CTL:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getctl/85987527EE188A49
** RCA-CRL:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcrl/85987527EE188A49

* Pair of CAs geographically restricted to Portugal, typically for provisioning R-ITS-S/RSU, and used for that purpose throughout the C-ROADS Portugal pilot projects: +
** EA-PT:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/BA12069B91B8E810
** AA-PT:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/9047B112864EDDFD

* Pair of CAs with no geographic restrictions, typically for provisioning V-ITS-S/OBU, and used for that purpose throughout the C-ROADS Portugal pilot projects: +
** EA-WW:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/CAC1A29FA18FAF14
** AA-WW:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/369F636239546522

* Generic pair of CAs with no restrictions, that can be used for testing or other general purposes: +
** EA-TS:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/4C87B1B09B8CD364
** AA-TS:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/0646294BB7BE3D8F

The service endpoints for provisioning of ECs and ATs are:

* EA:  https://0.ea.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/ec
* AA:  https://0.aa.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/at

As per the ETSI Standards, all of these endpoints are discoverable from the ECTL and RCA CTL.


## Registration

In order to use our PKI services and provision your equipment for security using our system, you (and/or your company) will need to do initial registration with our service desk. +
At the momment, access to this PKI system is limited to https://www.c-roads.eu/platform.html[C-ROADS Platform] participants/partners that provide correct and verifiable registration information.

For now, if you wish to apply, please send an e-mail to <TODO: email address> containing the following information:

<TODO: describe needed info>

This will provide you with the administrative and/or API credentials that are required to allow you to perform initial registration of your equipment in our platform. +

After that you may follow the specific instructions in this repository to initialize your equipment's security configuration, and it should be ready to manage the lifecycle of it's EC and AT certificates, as per the ETSI standards. 


## Technicalities


### Supported Hardware

Currently these are the tested and supported hardware systems are:

* COHDA MK5 release 17.0 (any moment now...)
* A-To-Be (comming soon)
* Siemens (comming soon)
* CTag (comming soon)


### Usage

You can find here the specific procedures and tools to help in  provisioning these C-ITS Station hardware models so that they may use our PKI system as the security certificate provider for your equipment:

- COHDA MK5 release 17.0 (any moment now...)
- A-To-Be (comming soon)
- Siemens (comming soon)
- CTag (comming soon)
