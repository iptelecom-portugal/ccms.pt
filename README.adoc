*C-ITS Credential Management System* by *IP Telecom* in *Portugal*.

(this is work in progress...)


## Introduction

The European Commission (EU) runs a C-ITS Point of Contact (CPOC). It provides a Trust List Manager (TLM) and a European Certificate Trust Lists (ECTL). Further details and related documnentation can de found at https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Documentation.html, including:

* https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/data/documents/c-its_security_policy_release_preparatory_phase_of_Delegated_Regulation_2019_1789.pdf[C-ITS Security Policy (EU SP)]
* https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/data/documents/c-its_certificate_policy_release_preparatory_phase_of_Delegated_Regulation_2019_1789.pdf[C-ITS Certificate Policy (EU CP)]
* https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/data/documents/CPOC_Protocol_Release1.pdf[CPOC Protocol (EU CPOC)]

Current EU CPOC artifacts are publicly available at:

* TLM:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/gettlmcertificate
* LINK:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/gettlmlinkcertificate
* ECTL:  https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/L0/getectl/1D261F9E338ECB5B

We run a PKI provider base on the current C-ITS security standards: +

* https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103000_103099/103097/01.03.01_60/ts_103097v010301p.pdf[ETSI TS 103 097 V1.3.1] - Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) ; Security ; Security  header and certificate formats.
* https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102900_102999/102941/01.03.01_60/ts_102941v010301p.pdf[ETSI TS 102 941 V1.3.1] - Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) ; Security ; Trust and Privacy Management.

At the moment the our PKI services are based on a Root Certification Authority (RCA) registered at the EC's https://cpoc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECTL.html[ECTL Level 0] trust domain, intended mainly for testing and pilot use cases. +


## Access

The main base URL for the Distribution Center (DC) of our current PKI services is: *https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/*

For reference, and manual or scripted access, current artifacts published by our PKI are directly accessible in native encoding [ASN.1 COER] at:

* Root CA registered at the ECTL Level 0
** RCA:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/85987527EE188A49
** RCA-CTL:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getctl/85987527EE188A49
** RCA-CRL:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcrl/85987527EE188A49

* Pair of CAs geographically restricted to Portugal, typically for provisioning R-ITS-S/RSU, and used for that purpose throughout the C-ROADS Portugal pilot projects: +
** EA-PT:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/BA12069B91B8E810
** AA-PT:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/9047B112864EDDFD

* Pair of CAs with no geographic restrictions, typically for provisioning V-ITS-S/OBU, and used for that purpose throughout the C-ROADS Portugal pilot projects: +
** EA-WW:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/CAC1A29FA18FAF14
** AA-WW:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/369F636239546522

* Generic pair of CAs with no restrictions, that can be used for testing or other general purposes: +
** EA-TS:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/4C87B1B09B8CD364
** AA-TS:  https://0.dc.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/getcacerts/0646294BB7BE3D8F

The two main service endpoints for security provisioning of stations are discoverable from the ECTL and RCA CTL, as per the ETSI standards:

* EA:  https://0.ea.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/ec
* AA:  https://0.aa.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/at


The full APIs (work-in-progress) are browsable from the root of each service instance:

* RCA/DC:  https://0.ea.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/
* EA:  https://0.aa.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/
* AA:  https://0.aa.pilot.croads.ccms.pt/


## Partner Registration

In order to use our PKI services and provision your equipment for security using our system, you (and/or your company) will need to do initial registration with our service desk. +
At the momment, access to this PKI system is limited to https://www.c-roads.eu/platform.html[C-ROADS Platform] participants/partners that provide correct and verifiable registration information.

If you wish to apply, please send an e-mail to *pki-croads@iptelecom.pt* containing the following information:

* Company Name
* Contact Name
* Contact Email
* EAs you wich to use (see list above).
* Number of stations you'll be needing to register, per EA.

We will then provide you with the credentials that are required to allow you to use the APIs and perform registration of your ITS Stations in our platform. +
After that you are ready to use the service APIs, and may follow more specific instructions in this repository to initialize your equipment's security configuration.
